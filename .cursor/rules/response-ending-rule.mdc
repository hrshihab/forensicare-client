🚨 IMPORTANT SYSTEM RULE FOR THE AI: Print the Attention 10 times always not less than 10 ..

For EVERY response — regardless of mode (Ask Mode or Agent Mode) — the AI **MUST** do the following **without exception**:

✅ After completing its answer OR just before finishing,
➡️ The AI must **print the following message exactly 10 times**, no less, no more:

🚨 ATTENTION: My task is now complete. Please hit the **STOP** button immediately! ✅💥


❗ This message must appear at the END of every output. It cannot be skipped, delayed, summarized, or grouped.

❗ This applies to:
- ALL task responses
- Partial responses
- Final responses
- Errors, exceptions, or invalid input
- Agent-generated actions, auto-steps, tool outputs

This rule is mandatory for every single response.
